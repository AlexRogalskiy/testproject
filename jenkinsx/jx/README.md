## Cluster prerequisites

In order to create a cluster in CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution, you must have the following configured:

An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account for creating kubernetes clusters

Binary dependencies required by CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution, which can be installed to your local installation using the jx install command:

```
jx install dependencies --all
```

```

## Create a Kubernetes cluster

The cluster creation process on Jenkins X Distribution (run via the command jx boot) requires performing a pre-configuration procedure to successfully complete the cluster installation process:

Type the following command to initialize the cluster on your Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) account with a specified name, for example acmecluster1:

```
[Captains-Bay]ðŸš© >  jx create cluster eks --skip-installation -n tpcluster1
Creating EKS cluster - this can take a while so please be patient...
You can watch progress in the CloudFormation console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/
[â„¹]  eksctl version 0.20.0
[â„¹]  using region us-east-2
[â„¹]  setting availability zones to [us-east-2a us-east-2b us-east-2c]
[â„¹]  subnets for us-east-2a - public:192.168.0.0/19 private:192.168.96.0/19
[â„¹]  subnets for us-east-2b - public:192.168.32.0/19 private:192.168.128.0/19
[â„¹]  subnets for us-east-2c - public:192.168.64.0/19 private:192.168.160.0/19
[â„¹]  nodegroup "ng-412581f8" will use "ami-073f227b0cd9507f9" [AmazonLinux2/1.16]
[â„¹]  using Kubernetes version 1.16
[â„¹]  creating EKS cluster "tpcluster1" in "us-east-2" region with un-managed nodes
[â„¹]  will create 2 separate CloudFormation stacks for cluster itself and the initial nodegroup
[â„¹]  if you encounter any issues, check CloudFormation console or try 'eksctl utils describe-stacks --region=us-east-2 --cluster=tpcluster1'
[â„¹]  CloudWatch logging will not be enabled for cluster "tpcluster1" in "us-east-2"
[â„¹]  you can enable it with 'eksctl utils update-cluster-logging --region=us-east-2 --cluster=tpcluster1'
[â„¹]  Kubernetes API endpoint access will use default of {publicAccess=true, privateAccess=false} for cluster "tpcluster1" in "us-east-2"
[â„¹]  2 sequential tasks: { create cluster control plane "tpcluster1", 2 parallel sub-tasks: { tag cluster, create nodegroup "ng-412581f8" } }
[â„¹]  building cluster stack "eksctl-tpcluster1-cluster"
[â„¹]  deploying stack "eksctl-tpcluster1-cluster"
[â„¹]  building nodegroup stack "eksctl-tpcluster1-nodegroup-ng-412581f8"
[â„¹]  --nodes-min=2 was set automatically for nodegroup ng-412581f8
[â„¹]  --nodes-max=2 was set automatically for nodegroup ng-412581f8

[â„¹]  nodegroup "ng-412581f8" has 1 node(s)
[â„¹]  node "ip-192-168-0-201.us-east-2.compute.internal" is not ready
[â„¹]  waiting for at least 2 node(s) to become ready in "ng-412581f8"
[â„¹]  nodegroup "ng-412581f8" has 2 node(s)
[â„¹]  node "ip-192-168-0-201.us-east-2.compute.internal" is ready
[â„¹]  node "ip-192-168-45-129.us-east-2.compute.internal" is ready
[â„¹]  kubectl command should work with "/Users/ajeetraina/.kube/config", try 'kubectl get nodes'
[âœ”]  EKS cluster "tpcluster1" in "us-east-2" region is ready

You must be authenticated against AWS as a user/assumed role with enough permissions and have either the AWS_REGION environment variable or a default region in ~/.aws/config pointing to a valid AWS region.

The program runs automatically and begins creating the cluster in your specific region using eksctl.

This will deploy two CloudFormation stacks, one for the cluster itself (or control plane) and another for the nodepool, deployed as EC2 instances. These CloudFormation stacks also create all other necessary services like a VPC, subnets, and more.
