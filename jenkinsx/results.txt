On AWS we recommend using a custom DNS name to access services in your Kubernetes cluster to ensure you can use all of your Availability Zones
If you do not have a custom DNS name you can use yet, then you can register a new one here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home?#DomainRegistration:
