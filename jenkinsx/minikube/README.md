Command "install" is deprecated, it will be removed on Jun 1 2020. We now highly recommend you use jx boot instead. Please check https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/ for more details.
? Configured Jenkins installation type: Serverless Jenkins X Pipelines with Tekton
Namespace jx created
Context "minikube" modified.

Waiting for external loadbalancer to be created and update the nginx-ingress-controller service in kube-system namespace
Using external IP: 192.168.64.2
You can now configure a wildcard DNS pointing to the new Load Balancer address 192.168.64.2
If you don't have a wildcard DNS setup then create a DNS (A) record and point it at: 192.168.64.2, then use the DNS domain in the next input...

If you do not have a custom domain setup yet, Ingress rules will be set for magic DNS nip.io.
Once you have a custom domain ready, you can update with the command jx upgrade ingress --cluster
