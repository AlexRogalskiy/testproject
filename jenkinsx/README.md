# Getting Started with Jenkins-X for AWS EKS

## Pre-requisite

- Macbook
- brew tap jenkins-x/jx

```
brew install jx
```


## Installing Jenkins X on EKS

```
jx create cluster eks --skip-installation
```

```
Missing required dependencies, deselect to avoid auto installing
- eksctl
- aws-iam-authenticator
- kubectl
- helm
```

On AWS we recommend using a custom DNS name to access services in your Kubernetes cluster to ensure you can use all of your Availability Zones
If you do not have a custom DNS name you can use yet, then you can register a new one here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home?#DomainRegistration:
? Would you like to register a wildcard DNS ALIAS to point at this ELB address?  Yes

? Enter your custom domain that we can use to setup a Route 53 ALIAS record to point at the ELB host: a8ef316d4a40811ea9f560a448cc2ced-0bb0b6f20b00c479.elb.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
? Your custom DNS name:
```

# Addng Custom DNS Name

During the install process, jx will ask questions for customizing your setup. One of them is about the wildcard DNS alias that will point at the main Jenkins X load balancer. You can use the free service nip.io for setting this up; check the hostname of the ELB:

```
[Captains-Bay]ðŸš© >  kubectl get svc -n kube-system jxing-nginx-ingress-controller
