Creating cluster...
WARNING: Currently VPC-native is not the default mode during cluster creation. In the future, this will become the default mode and can be disabled using `--no-enable-ip-alias` flag. Use `--[no-]enable-ip-alias` flag to suppress this warning.
WARNING: Newly created clusters and node-pools will have node auto-upgrade enabled by default. This can be disabled using the `--no-enable-autoupgrade` flag.
WARNING: Starting with version 1.18, clusters will have shielded GKE nodes by default.
WARNING: Your Pod address range (`--cluster-ipv4-cidr`) can accommodate at most 1008 node(s).
This will enable the autorepair feature for nodes. Please see https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-repair for more information on node autorepairs.

Waiting to find the external host name of the ingress controller Service in namespace kube-system with name jxing-nginx-ingress-controller
You can now configure a wildcard DNS pointing to the new Load Balancer address 104.196.49.126
If you don't have a wildcard DNS setup then create a DNS (A) record and point it at: 104.196.49.126, then use the DNS domain in the next input...

If you do not have a custom domain setup yet, Ingress rules will be set for magic DNS nip.io.
Once you have a custom domain ready, you can update with the command jx upgrade ingress --cluster
